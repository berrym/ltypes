This is a generic imlpentation of singly and doubly linked lists in compliance
with C99 standards (probably).

The idea behind these library functions is that lists of different data types
are implemented only once by using void functions and refernce parameters instead of
hard coding the type.

DISCLAIMER: This is CS-101.  For fun!
